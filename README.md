# Dutchtreats

**E-commerce App - Fourth milestone project; Full stack frameworks with Django - Code Institute **

Dutchtreats is a web application where users can buy typical Dutch foods online and have it delivered
at home. Users can create and update a profile, find information about the products, write reviews, 
add items to a cart, and pay for these items using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-nl). Users can also
learn about the company on the about page and get in contact with Dutchtreats using a contact form. 

As a Dutchmen who travels a lot, sometimes I miss Dutch foods. I love to try new foods and enjoy local cuisine.
However, sometimes I wish I could get my hands on some Dutch foods wherever I am. This inspired me to build this 
web application.
