# Dutchtreats

**E-commerce App - Fourth milestone project; Full stack frameworks with Django - Code Institute**

Dutchtreats is a web application where users can buy typical Dutch foods online and have it delivered
at home. Users can create and update a profile, find information about the products, write reviews, 
add items to a cart, and pay for these items using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-nl). Users can also
learn about the company on the about page and get in contact with Dutchtreats using a contact form. 

As a Dutchman who travels a lot, sometimes I miss Dutch foods. I love to try new foods and enjoy local cuisine.
However, sometimes I wish I could get my hands on some Dutch foods wherever I am. This inspired me to build this 
web application.

The web application was made for educational purposes only, it's not a real webshop.

## Demo

[Live website](https://dutchtreats.herokuapp.com/). The apllication is hosted on [Heroku](www.heroku.com) and uses a 
Heroku Postgress database.

## UX

### Users

Users of Dutchtreats are people who don't have access to Dutch foods where they live. The Netherlands has several delicasies
that are delicious and (almost) only available in The Netherlands. Dutch expats working in other countries, or others
who have stayed in The Netherlands and are back home can now order these foods online and have them delivered to their home.
